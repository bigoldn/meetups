* Mixture of Markov Chains - Jose Llarena
Mixture of Markov Chains is a simple generative probabilistic model that can applied directly to raw sequential data like clickstreams or DNA sequences without any further pre-processing. In this talk I will describe its representation as a graphical model, how it relates to other probabilistic models, how to estimate its parameters via Expectation-Maximization, and how to use for clustering, data generation, density estimation and missing data completion.
