Blurb:

* The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is an algorithm used in well-known data compression tools such as bzip2. It works by permuting the input characters in the text and grouping similar characters close to each other. This is useful for subsequent compression by run-length encoding or move-to-front transforms. Apart from compression, the BWT also allows efficent pattern matching, both exact and with errors. I present applications of the Burrows-Wheeler transform with a focus of data from DNA sequencing experiments.

Bio: Ole Schulz-Trieglaff studied Computer Science and Bioinformatics in Berlin, Uppsala and Edinburgh. After a PhD in Computer Science at the Free University Berlin, he joined the Computational Biology R&D department of Illumina in Chesterford, UK. Ole has broad research interests in algorithm development and data mining.

* The Master Theorem - Christina Nicolau

The master theorem provides an out of the box method for computing the complexity of certain classes of Divide et Impera algorithms. We'll be looking inside the box to see how the magic happens! 
Bio: Seasoned computer scientist with over a decade experience, specialized in working on large scale enterprise web applications. Acquired an interest in algorithms by competing in math and computer science contests, currently keeping the interest alive on Project Euler (well before it was hacked!).
