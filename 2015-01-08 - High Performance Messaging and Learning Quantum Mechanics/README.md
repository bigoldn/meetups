* The next generation in high-performance messaging - Martin Thompson

Does TCP not meet your required latency consistently? Is UDP not reliable enough? Do you need to multicast? What about flow control, congestion control, and a means to avoid head of line blocking that can be integrated with ithe application? Or perhaps you're just fascinated by how to design for the cutting edge of performance? Maybe you have tried higher level messaging products and found they are way too complicated because of the feature bloat driven by product marketing cycles.

Aeron takes it back-to-basics with a pure focus on performance and reliability. We have built it from the ground up with mechanical sympathy in its DNA. The data structures are lock-free, wait-free, and copy-free and even persistent for our functional friends. Interaction with the media is layered so you can swap between UDP, Inifiniband, or Shared Memory as required.

This talk will focus on the design of Aeron and what we learned trying to achieve very consistent performance. We will explore the challenges of dealing with reliable message delivery over UDP and the data structures necessary to support transmission and retransmission in in a lock-free and wait-free manner. 
Bio: Martin is a high-performance and low-latency specialist, with experience gained over two decades working on the bleeding edge of large transactional and big-data systems. He believes in Mechanical Sympathy, i.e. applying an understanding of the hardware to the creation of software as being fundamental to delivering elegant high-performance solutions. The Disruptor framework is just one example of what his mechanical sympathy has created.

Martin was the co-founder and CTO of LMAX. He blogs at mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com, and can be found giving training courses on performance and concurrency when he is not cutting code to make systems better.

* Learning Quantum Mechanics : Machines versus Humans - Alan Nichol 
All of materials science, chemistry, and biology can in principle be predicted from the equations of quantum mechanics. In practice this turns out to be non-trivial. I will look at how machine learning algorithms, in conjunction with theory devised over the last century, are enabling a step-change in our ability to understand the material world from first principles. It is my intention that this leads to a discussion of the role of domain expertise in machine learning. 

Bio: Alan does research in computer simulation, applying machine learning to the simulation of matter at the atomic scale. He has a degree in chemical physics (Edinburgh) and is completing a phd in engineering (Cambridge). In the past he worked on problems in nuclear physics, condensed matter, and polymer science. He loves playing with the latest languages and tools but still believes fortran, emacs, and numerical recipes are all that's needed to tackle a problem.
