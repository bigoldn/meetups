# The Satisfiability Problem and Applications - Mate Soos

In this presentation, I plan to talk about the base of all NP-complete problems, the satisfiability problem, how these problems are being solved with state-of-the-art SAT solvers, and how that is relevant to our everyday lives. SAT solvers have enjoyed a boom thanks to massive improvements through the use of lazy data structures, tricky graph algorithms, proof verification, and heuristics. This allowed SAT solvers to thrive in many different tasks such as hardware verification,software fuzzing, cryptography, and math proofs. In this talk we will examine some of the core data structures and algorithms used by SAT solvers, as well as show some example use-cases for them in different fields.

Bio: Mate Soos has been working with SAT solvers for seven years, and is the developer of the SAT solver CryptoMiniSat. When not working on SATor SMT solvers, he is working as a security consultant, breaking cars(with FPGAs), Oyster cards (with SAT solvers) and SIM cards (withrainbow tables).

# Algorithms for intelligent vehicles - Peter Ondruska

In this talk we will look at a new algorithmic solution mitigating the effect of "range-anxiety" of electric vehicle owners, i.e. the fear of running out of the battery. We first employ automatic machine learning to learn how different drivers affect consumption of an electric car. We then use this knowledge to design a new efficient graph-planning algorithm to predict effective drivable range tailored for individual drivers.

Bio: Peter is a PhD student at Oxford University Mobile Robotics Group and has a strong background in algorithm design. His primary focus is on applications of Artificial Intelligence in robotics and his further research interests span areas as diverse as deep machine learning, inverse reinforcement learning, computer vision, planning and natural language processing. Peter  has done internships in Facebook, Google, Microsoft Research and MetaMind. In his free time he enjoys participation in algorithmic programming competitions like TopCoder and Codeforces where he enjoys notable success.
