# Random Jungles and Isolation Forests - Padarn Wilson 

In this talk I will describe and motivate two different ensemble techniques which can be seen as extensions of the incredibly popular Random Forests, which I approach purely out of curiosity. The first is the 'Isolation Forest', which uses Random Forest for anomaly detection. The second is 'Random Jungles' which are an extension of Random Forests to ensembles of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) rather than simple trees. I'll talk about my experience in implementing and testing out these ideas, and why one might use them. 


Bio: Padarn is a computational Mathematician from New Zealand. Without claiming to be an expert, his interest is in the analysis, design and implementation of algorithms for problems involving uncertainty (so Machine Learning). He is excited by exploring new algorithms and trying to figure out where they might be useful. 


# Deadline Driven Design - Jim Parr 

Design engineers are often faced with the challenge of finding high performance designs within a deadline or under resource constraints. A Formula One team needs to identify the optimal car set up before the start of a race with limited wind tunnel and CPU hours. A UAV designer may be tasked with the rapid development of a sensorcraft for specific flight conditions and payload in response to a environmental accident or volcanic eruption. In both cases, an optimal approach to design search is paramount to remain competitive or minimise disruption. Here we explore elements of machine learning that can be used to speed up the design process and encourage the development of methods that exploit human-machine symbiosis.

Bio: Jim Parr is a Data Scientist at McLaren Applied Technologies. He has worked on a variety of projects across consumer brands and performance sports to energy and healthcare. He focuses on the development of algorithms and tools that deliver insight and improve  decision making, leading to performance gains and improvements in efficiency.
