# Bayesian network internals - John Sandiford

A look inside the algorithms that underpin probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks and Dynamic Bayesian networks for time series modelling, as well as parameter learning on distributed platforms such as Hadoop & Spark.

Bio: John Sandiford is the CTO at Bayes Server.  He has 15 years' experience implementing and applying machine learning algorithms and a PhD in the field from Imperial.

# Multi-instance deep learning - Razvan Ranca 

Deep learning has been making spectacular improvements towards computer understanding of high-dimensional, sensory, data. Recently human performance has been surpassed on the 1000 class Imagenet benchmark. These rapid developments have, however, left many gaps in our understanding of the power of these methods. In this talk I will look at the challenges involved in extending deep learning classifiers to handle multiple-instance data. That is, instead of receiving a set of instances which are individually labeled, the networks must receive a set of labeled bags, each containing many instances. I'll look at how current deep learning architectures handle this problem, and in how humans can intervene to give the networks a hand. 

Bio: Razvan obtained a Bsc. from the University of Edinburgh and an MPhil from University of Cambridge, both in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning. Worked on projects ranging from reconstructing shredded documents to improving probabilistic programming languages. Currently co-founder at Tractable, working on applying deep learning to automate inspection tasks.
