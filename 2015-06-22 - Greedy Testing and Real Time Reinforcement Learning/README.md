# Greedy Algorithms for Testing - David Maclver (@DRMacIver) 

Testing libraries like Quickcheck generate random data to break tests, then greedily apply a simplification function to prune them down to more legible examples. This approach works well for small examples and fast tests, but as you move out of that area it starts to break down. In this talk I show how simple alternations to the greedy algorithm and some clever choices of simplification can drastically improve performance and example quality at the same time.  

Bio: David R. MacIver is a mathematician turned software developer who likes randomized algorithms and combinatorial optimisation. He wrote Hypothesis, a Quickcheck derived testing library for Python, and it's not short on either of those.

# Reinforcement Learning and its use in real-time applications - Charles Galambos (@craftit)

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful technique for identifying the best actions to take to achieve a goal.  In this talk you will see some of the algorithms used to learn effective behaviours. In particular I will look at temporal differencing and how it can be used in conjunction with a recurrent neural network in a real time environment.

Bio: Charles Galambos PhD is a co-founder of Aiseedo, a machine intelligence company and he leads its software development.  Dr Galambos is an acknowledged expert in the design and development of machine learning and image processing technology.  He was responsible for the creation of the world leading video analysis product Magellanâ„¢.  He was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Surrey in 2000, for original work in computer vision.
