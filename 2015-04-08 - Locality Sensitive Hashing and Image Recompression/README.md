# Locality-sensitive hashing - Eddie Bell ([@ejlbell](http://twitter.com/jgrahamc)) 
LSH is a dimensional reduction method that is commonly used for speeding up search. In this presentation I'll talk about two ways to do LSH. The first is completely stateless (excluding the PRNG seed) but can only be used with certain distributions of data. The second is stateful and requires training but it is has less strict assumptions concerning the distribution of data. 

Bio: Eddie is an ex-finance PhD who saw the light and joined a start-up. He 
is the lead data scientist (aka the fashematician) at Lyst and he solves fashion data problems using NLP, ML and image processing. He likes describing himself in the third person.

# Image Recompression - John Graham Cummings ([@jgrahamc](https://twitter.com/ejlbell))

GIF, PNG, JPEG. All have different ways of compressing images. This talk will explain how those common image types are compressed and how it's possible to recompress images to achieve the smallest file size possible.

Bio: Dr John Graham-Cumming is an experienced programmer who works for CloudFlare, Inc. He is probably best known for having originated a successful petition to the British Government asking for an apology for its persecution of Alan Turing. He is author of The Geek Atlas, and started an organization whose aim is to build [Charles Babbage's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).
