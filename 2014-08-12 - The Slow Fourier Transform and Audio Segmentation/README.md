* The Slow Fourier Transform - Tom Nielsen

The Fourier transform is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. I will show a simple Bayesian statistical model for which the posterior probability distribution is equivalent to the output of the Fourier transform. I will show how this model can be implemented and run in probabilistic programming languages. Although this probabilistic approach is much slower than the Fast Fourier Transform, I will discuss some use cases in which it may be advantageous.

Bio: Tom Nielsen is the founder of OpenBrain Ltd, which is developing applications at the intersection of Bayesian statistical modelling, functional programming and web development. OpenBrain's core platform is the Baysig statistical programming language and the BayesHive web application for collaborative Bayesian data analysis. Tom Nielsen has a PhD in synaptic physiology from UCL and has now largely forgotten every programming language he learned before discovering Haskell in 2007. 

* Audio Segmentation and Clustering - Catherine Breslin (@catherinebuk)

The introduction of smartphone assistants like Siri and Google Now has popularised speech recognition. A less well-known use of speech technology is indexing audio and video archives, such as lectures, meetings or TV broadcasts. Automatic transcription allows people to search these far more easily than relying on meta data alone. However, before speech recognition can be applied to such long audio streams, pre-processing is needed to break up the audio into smaller segments and identify which speakers are present in the recording. This talk will focus on algorithms for audio segmentation and clustering, which allow us to answer the question "Who spoke when?" 

Bio: Catherine is a research engineer at Amazon working on speech technology, dialogue, language and machine learning. She holds a PhD in Engineering from Cambridge University, and has since spent time working on speech technology in both industry and academia.
