# Omnia mutantur, and other data mining pitfalls - Emma Tonkin

The use of data drawn from the social web or from large sets of textual resources consistently carries with it the challenge of unpredictability.  This talk explores some of the issues with mining and processing of natural language information encountered during recent research projects exploring aspects of social activity on the Web. In particular, issues arise from domain-specificity and social contextualisation, which lead to difficulties in applying machine learning systems across domains and over time, such as potential variation in accuracy.

Bio: Emma Tonkin is a researcher at King's College London, where she is currently researching the application of time series analysis to evaluate obsolescence in digital preservation. She originally trained as a physicist at the University of Bath, and worked at several internet start-ups, enterprises and research departments in England, France and Germany. She returned to Bath for an MSc in Human-Computer Communication, which led to research roles in web engineering, robotics and computer vision. Subsequent research included applications of machine learning to digital library problems and to study of the social web. She holds a PhD from the University of Bristol in Computer Science on the topic of context-awareness via social and physical sensors, as well as Open University qualifications in modern languages and classical studies.


# Questions on Language Data - Alastair Gill

It used to be a life’s work to collect language data, and for some linguists this was literally the case. Although now we are mainly concerned with how to process the large amounts of  data that we come into contact with, I want to take a step back. Using examples from my own research I will give an alternative view of the kinds of questions we want to ask our of our language data, and where text mining and natural language processing techniques fit into this. 

Bio: Alastair Gill is a researcher and developer in the Department of Digital Humanities, King’s College London. Alastair's research focuses on the interaction of technology with the social processes of communication and collaboration. In particular, his work focuses on language to study influence and knowledge construction online, as well as the expression and perception of characteristics such as personality, emotion and trust, and he has published widely in these areas. After taking his Ph.D in Informatics in 2004 at the University of Edinburgh, Alastair has undertaken postdoctoral research in psychology, communications and sociology, in Europe and the US. He has worked on text mining projects with the Wikimedia Foundation and HEFCE (the university funding body), and has been invited to give talks on his research at a variety of places including Yahoo! Research Sunnyvale, Siemens xTechnology to Business Center Berkeley, Kellogg Management School, Northwestern University, and Cornell University.
