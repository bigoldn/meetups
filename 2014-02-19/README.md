Blurb:

* Spherical geometry algorithms in D3.js - Jason Davies

Algorithms designed to work on a 2D plane don’t necessarily work on the surface of a sphere.  I will describe some of the algorithms used by d3.geo for geographic computation.

Bio: Jason Davies is a freelance programmer.  His work and interests involve combining visualisation with mathematics, data structures and algorithms.  He is a co-author of D3.js, an open-source visualisation library.

* Quantum computing and Cryptography - Anish Mohammed

Bio: Anish Mohammed has been an electronics enthusiast and software hacker since his early teens. He endured medical school, before spending almost a decade in research and development in security and cryptography. He has spent time researching cryptographic algorithms & protocols and, for a short while, did research on quantum authentication protocols among other things. Has spent time in three different research groups working on security and cryptography. These days he works as a technology strategy consultant. He is also a self-proclaimed UAV addict who owns a dozen AHRS/Autopilots with interests in multicopters, fixed wings and rovers. He is also interested in cloud computing and data science.
