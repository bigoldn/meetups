* Probabilistic Counting on ClickStream data using Amazon Kinesis or Storm - Michael Vogiatzis

The probabilistic (approximate) counting algorithm allows the counting of a large number of events using a small amount of memory. Michael will demonstrate how we can efficiently scale this algorithm in a cluster of machines in order to analyze web activity. For this purpose, a real-time streaming framework will be used and explained - either Amazon Kinesis or Storm.
