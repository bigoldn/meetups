• How to make a squishy map - Robin Houston (@robinhouston) 

Squishy maps – more formally known as continuous area cartograms – are a fun and useful way to represent certain sorts of geographic data. Various algorithms have been used to construct them over the years, but my favourite is the 2004 diffusion-based method invented by Michael Gastner and Mark Newman. I’ll explain how it works, and show some examples. 

Bio: Robin is a founder of the data visualisation studio Kiln (www.kiln.it). He’s been making websites since the ’90s, and has also worked on theoretical computer science and bioinformatics.
