Blurb:

* Rolling Hashes and Compression Algorithms - Dr John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc)

Rolling hashes are fast to compute and can be used to identify 'similar' strings in blocks of data. This talk will will look at some uses of rolling hashes for string comparison and compression focussing on the rsync protocol, a spam filter, and a delta compression technique.

Bio: Dr John Graham-Cumming is an experienced programmer who works for CloudFlare, Inc. He is probably best known for having originated a successful petition to the British Government asking for an apology for its persecution of Alan Turing. He is author of The Geek Atlas, and started an organization whose aim is to build Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.

* Scaling up k-nearest neighbours classification - Andrew Clegg (@andrew_clegg)

k-nearest neighbours or kNN is one of the simplest machine learning methods to understand, and has many appealing properties, but a naive implementation will have problems on very large data sets. This talk will introduce the algorithm, describe its performance characteristics, and discuss some tricks to speed it up on differentkinds of data -- and how to apply them in a production setting.

Bio: Andrew left the Web 1.0 scene in 2001 to engage in more esoteric pursuits, and since then has bounced around a number of different fields and industry sectors including computational linguistics, bioinformatics, healthcare research, social media, publishing, online games and education. These days he leads Pearson's Data Analytics & Visualization team in London.
