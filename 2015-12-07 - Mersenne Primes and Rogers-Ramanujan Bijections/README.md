# Mersenne Primes and Related Algorithms - Blair Azzopardi

Prime numbers turn up in surprising places and are utilised extensively in the world of cryptography. I will look at a particular class of prime numbers made popular by the staggering size of the ones that have been discovered. I will also examine how we can tell that these numbers are truly prime and some of the algorithmic techniques used in this process. There will be some exploration in leveraging GPU devices in applying some of these techniques.

Bio: Blair is an amateur mathematician originally from Sussex. He enjoys researching many different fields from applied mathematics to number theory. In his spare time, he also likes to build robots with his Raspberry Pi.

# Generalized Rogers-Ramanujan bijections - Paul Hammond

Bijections are mappings from sets onto themselves. Some bijections in combinatorial number theory can be defined iteratively, but not (it seems) in an explicit closed form. I will explore one such bijection that can be expressed neatly as an algorithm. 

Bio: Paul is a mathematics tutor at the University of Brighton International College. He has a DPhil from the University of Sussex, and was partly responsible for the invention of (what is now known as) the Hammond-Lewis birank.
