* Introduction to lock-free programming - Sergio Rodríguez Valencia (@chickentyping)

Multi-cored systems are getting more and more prevalent every day. From the humblest phone SoC to the most powerful server processor we are seeing a continuously increasing number of cores. Unfortunately, applying traditional multi-threaded techniques on these system has proved to be difficult - so much so that sometimes the concurrent version of a program can be slower than the non-concurrent one!

Since 2001 there has been increasing interest and research on the area of lock-free programming, which enables programmers to write concurrent code without resorting to locks. In this talk we will present some lock-free data structures that apply lock-free techniques, we will have a look at the advantages these techniques provide, and which traditional concurrency problems they sidestep.

Bio: Sergio has over 10 years experience working on time-constrained industrial and backend systems. He is currently working at eBay Europe as a software developer, where he enjoys wrestling with big-data and event-driven programming.

* How to Design Perfect (Software) Products - Pieter Hintjens (@hintjens)

I'll present an algorithm and process ("Simplicity Oriented Design") for software product development, based on a living supply chain, formal contracts, and self-organizing lock-free actors. A more verbose explanation of the process is here:  http://hintjens.com/blog:19

Bio: Pieter Hintjens is a writer, programmer and thinker who has spent decades building large software systems and on-line communities, which he describes as "Living Systems". He is an expert in distributed computing, having written many protocols and distributed software systems. He founded the ZeroMQ free software project in 2007, and in 2013 launched the edgenet project to build a fully secure, anonymous peer-to-peer Internet. He is the author of "ZeroMQ - Messaging for Many Applications" (O'Reilly), "Code Connected", and "Culture and Empire: Digital Revolution". His blog is at hintjens.com.

He's been a strong critic of the patent system, leading the European effort to ban software patents from 2005 to 2007.

His company, iMatix, provides support to the ZeroMQ market, and in this role he's traveled the world, teaching, coaching and helping others to organize successfully.

He defined the term "Social Architecture" as the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community, and has promoted the techniques of social architecture in articles and at conferences. He's a member of Mensa and Rotary International and spends most of his time writing and contributing to the ZeroMQ project and other projects.
