* Gibbs Sampling: Some Theory and Some Practice - Dominic Steinitz

This talk introduces the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm and Gibbs Sampling describing some of theory and giving some very simple examples from statistics using Haskell, JAGS (via R) and STAN (via R)and a more complex example from physics (the Ising Model).

Bio: Dominic Steinitz is a mathematician / statistician / functional programmer who has worked as a statistician in medical research,market research and computer network modelling before moving into running large IT projects in the airline industry and large information security projects in banking. He has been writing in Haskell for over 20 years, contributes regularly to the Haskell community and has worked professionally on embedded domain specific languages in Haskell for web analytics and exotic financial derivatives. He completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos atCambridge specialising in mathematical statistics and has a Ph.D. inComputer Science. He is currently using control theory and Bayesian statistics in developing a medical device.

* Learning word embeddings from text - Piotr Mirowski

A recent development in statistical language modeling happened when distributional semantics (the idea of defining words in relation to other words) met neural networks. Classical language modelling consists in assigning probabilities to sentences by factorizing the joint likelihood of the sentence into conditional likelihoods of each word given that word¿s context. Neural language models further try to "embed" each word into a low-dimensional vector-space representation that can be learned as the language model is trained. When they are trained on very large corpora, these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many applications such as speech recognition or sentence completion.

Bio: Piotr Mirowski is a data scientist who works as a software engineer at Microsoft Bing in London, where he focuses on NLP and deep learning techniques for search query formulation. He is passionate about deep
learning, statistical language models and time series analysis, passions he acquired by doing his PhD at New York University under the guidance of neural network expert Yann LeCun. Piotr loves to solve real world problems and has focused his studies on many different projects, including epileptic seizure prediction from EEG and inference of gene regulation networks. In his previous job as a research scientist at Bell Labs, Piotr delivered an electric load forecasting solution to a power utility, hacked a Kinect-powered mobile robot that mapped the WiFi signal strength (for indoor geo-localization) and coded Simultaneous Localization and Mapping from the pocket (reconstructing a 3D trajectory using only sensors present on a smartphone). He loves backpacking and improv theatre acting.
