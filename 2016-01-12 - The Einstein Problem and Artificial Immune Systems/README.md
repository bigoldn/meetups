# Hilbert, Turing and the 'einstein' problem - David Fletcher 

This will be a whirlwind tour of the mathematical field of aperiodic tilings (such as the 'Penrose' tiling).We will cover their genesis in the famous 'Hilbert problems' posed at the beginning of the 20th century, and show how these tilings connect to Turing Machines and the halting problem.This talk will end with a summary of the 'Einstein' or 'one tile' problem- the search for a single tile design which can cover the entire plane, but only in a nonperiodic way.

Bio: David Fletcher obtained a PhD in the mathematics of aperiodic tilings, from Leicester University (with MMath from Warwick).He has recently changed focus slightly, and is rapidly specializing in machine learning and data. This involved working for Tesco on optimizing store trials and predicting food promotion sales, and is now in a SaaS company collecting and analyzing data from retail fridges to help drive sales (Elstat/Nexo).

# Optimisation of Complex Magnetic Systems at Diamond Light Source with Artificial Immune Systems - Mark Basham

Insertion Devices(IDs) are one of the key components of a modern Synchrotron Light Source, the sorting and shimming of imperfect permanent magnets to enable the production of optimised IDs is a well explored problem which we look to extend here. There are currently two main computational approaches to finding a solution: Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms, which are implemented in FORTRAN77 and C++ respectively. This presentation discusses the redevelopment of this code in Python, making use of more modern and better suited algorithms, such as Artificial Immune Systems, and how it compares to the Fortran code in terms of performance, maintainability and user interaction. Finally we will discuss the advantages of using the Dawn IDE for this project, specifically the variety of tools it gives the developer through to the visual and data browsing features which allow for an excellent end user experience.

Bio: Dr Mark Basham is a Senior Software Scientist at Diamond Light Source, the UKâ€™s national synchrotron facility located on the RAL campus in  South Oxfordshire.  Mark was awarded his Physics PhD in surface science simulation from Reading University, he then moved to data analysis of synchrotron data after working with experimental colleagues in the field.  Mark is a strong believer in Open Source software, spending a lot of his time working on open data analysis software projects such as Dawn Science (www.dawnsci.org) and OptID (https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/Opt-ID), the latter of which is a set of codes designed to optimise Insertion Devices at the facility.  Mark has a real passion for public engagement; he is the creator of the Lego Beamline (#legobeamline) which helps to explain how Synchrotron experiments are performed.
