* Numerical Optimization by Jurgen van Gaal (@jvangael), Datascience Director at Rangespan

Numerical Optimization is at the core of many sciences. My personal background is in machine learning and pretty much any algorithm in this space does numerical optimization of a multivariate function: e.g. neural network training . In this talk I want to give an overview of multivariate numerical optimization. I'll cover line search, gradient descent, Newton methods and quasi-Newton methods. The goal of the talk will be for people to understand the different properties of different algorithms.

* Implementing Lock-less Look Up Tables in a NegaMax Search by Okash Khawaja, R&D at Draycir Ltd

NegaMax search is used to find the best possible decision in a zero-sum game under limited time. In many of its applications, the search encounters same situations that it had previously evaluated. Therefore one way to optimize it is to store its results in a look up table. However, when the search is parallelized, a lock-less look up table is required. In this talk we will closely follow the example of a chess engine as an application of negamax search and explore the implementation of such a lock-less look up table.
