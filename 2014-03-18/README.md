* B-trees and R-trees - Neri van Otten
B-trees and R-trees are two types of trees providing a basic index structure. Different variations of these structures have been proposed to solve specific problems and carry out performance optimisation. In this talk these variations will be discussed and compared. Comparison will be made with respect to complexity, structure, query type support, data type support and application.

Bio: Neri Van Otten is a data scientist at Conversocial. Loves machine learning and natural language processing. On a daily basis she works with social data from twitter and facebook to derive that special insight and predict the future. Some might say this is magical.

* Why Topological Data Analysis Beats Dimension Reduction - Edward Kibardin

Topological Data Analysis is a new way of visualising and analysing complex, high dimensional data sets. Edward will briefly describe the idea behind TDA and present visualisations for well known Netflix and Yelp data sets. He will compare TDA visualisations with the popular dimension reduction algorithms and talk about TDA data preparation requirements including large matrix factorisation tricks. Presentation will also cover the dynamic UI for TDA data analysis.

Bio: Most recently, Edward has been performing large scale analysis in the consumer internet space at Base79, YouTube’s No. 1 content partner in EMEA. As Head of Data and Analytics, he is turning data into business solutions using the cutting-edge technologies such as time series analysis, machine learning, map-reduce and good old SQL. Edward enhanced his big data analytical skills during his past experience at Google. In a previous life, he led a number of multi-million migration/integration projects for the world’s largest telecom companies such as Telus (Canada), France Telecom, DoCoMo (Japan), DU (Dubai). Edward has recently been actively pushing the big data visual presentation forward with the help of topological data analysis algorithms.
