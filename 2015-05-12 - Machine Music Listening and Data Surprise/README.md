# Clever Hans, Clever Algorithms: Are your machine learnings learning what you think? - Bob Sturm (@boblsturm)

In machine learning, generalisation is the aim, and overfitting is the bane; but just because one avoids the latter does not guarantee the former. Of particular importance in some applications of machine learning is the “sanity" of the models learnt. In this talk I discuss one discipline in which model sanity is essential -- machine music listening — and how several hundreds of research publications may have unknowingly built, tuned, tested, compared and advertised “horses” instead of solutions. The true cautionary tale of the horse-genius Clever Hans provides the most appropriate illustration, but also ways forward. (B. L. Sturm, “A simple method to determine if a music information retrieval system is a “horse”,” IEEE Trans. Multimedia, vol. 16, no. 6, pp. [masked], 2014.)

Bio: Since the beginning of this year, I have been a lecturer in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/). I specialise in audio and music signal processing, machine listening, and valuation. I tried riding a horse once (named “Trigger"), and never want to repeat the experience.

# Information surprise or how to find interesting data - Oleksandr Pryymak 

What is curiosity? How can we measure and model surprise of discovery? Philosophical questions, which have been pondered from different angles, also found definitions in Bayesian framework. I'll touch some basics, review few ideas,  and finally, illustrate on Twitter data how we can cherry pick the most interesting data. 

Bio: I design new analytical tools for advertisers at Facebook UK. Prior to this, I analysed behaviour of web users at an advertising startup. In 2012, I graduated from the University of Southampton with my Ph.D. in studying opinion sharing models and decentralised algorithms to facilitate consensus. Between 2005 and 2009 I run with partners a small software company perusing our own products ideas.
